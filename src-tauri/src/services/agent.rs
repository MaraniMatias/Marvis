//! A minimal OpenCode bridge: a client of the service the person running OpenCode started.
//!
//! Everything Marvis needs from the agent is scoped to the checkout that owns it, so every
//! request names that checkout's directory and every response is checked against the expected
//! path before it is trusted. A `ses_…` id from one checkout is meaningless in another's
//! directory, and `agent_session` is what enforces that.
//!
//! The service is the user's, not this app's. Nothing here starts one and nothing here ends one:
//! `services::opencode` finds the service that is already running, and the absence of one leaves
//! the app disconnected rather than leaving a server behind.
//!
//! # What the service cannot tell us
//!
//! JSON requests carry the checkout's directory twice, because the service reads the scope two
//! ways: the `x-opencode-directory` header decides which location answers, and the `directory`
//! query parameter filters session lists. Sending the header alone leaves `/api/session`
//! answering for every location the service knows, and sending the query alone leaves `/api/agent`
//! answering for the service's own working directory. The SSE request carries the header too;
//! each event is additionally filtered by its reported location when one is present.
//!
//! OpenCode 2.0.22 has no client registry. There is no route that reports which TUI process is
//! attached to which session, the `x-opencode-client` header is only ever sent *out* to model
//! providers, and `/api/session/active` answers for the whole service rather than for one
//! connection. So a session cannot be attributed to the terminal that is showing it. What *is*
//! available per terminal is the directory it runs in, which is what `terminal_agent_rows` uses:
//! it reports each terminal's own directory scope instead of guessing which session that
//! terminal has selected. Guessing from `time.viewed` or from recency would misattribute the
//! moment two TUIs share a checkout, which is the case this has to be right for.
