/**
 * Where the thumb of a Marvis overlay scrollbar goes.
 *
 * The arithmetic is the scrollbar every desktop has had for thirty years: the thumb is as much of
 * the track as the viewport is of the content, never smaller than a thumb you can catch, and its
 * position along the rest of the track is the fraction of the content that is behind you — the same
 * fraction, which is why dragging it moves the viewport by the right amount.
 *
 * This file is the whole job and it is a function over four numbers with no DOM in it, so the
 * arithmetic can be read and tested without a scrolling box attached. The three it is given are the
 * ones the DOM already keeps (`scrollTop`, `scrollHeight`, `clientHeight`), which is what lets the
 * terminal map its scrollback onto the same three numbers and share this rather than keep a copy:
 * lines are pixels here, and a line of scrollback is `scrollHeight`, the visible rows are
 * `clientHeight` and `viewportY` is `scrollTop`.
 *
 * Every number is clamped rather than trusted. A scrollport is measured by a box whose content can
 * change between one measure and the next — a row folds, a virtual list swaps its window, a document
 * finishes loading — and `scrollTop` can sit past the end of a content height that has just shrunk,
 * which would otherwise throw the thumb off the bottom of its own track.
