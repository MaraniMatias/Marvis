/**
 * The paths and the web links a terminal line is offering, found without touching the disk.
 *
 * A terminal prints paths the way a shell hands them over, and the same file appears as
 * `src/lib/x.ts`, `./src/lib/x.ts` and `/Users/me/work/src/lib/x.ts`. It also decorates them:
 * rustc appends `:42:10`, a shell quotes anything with a space in it, and a sentence ends the
 * token in a full stop that is not part of the name. So this is one pass over the line plus the
 * trimming that turns a run of characters into the path a person meant.
 *
 * A URL is offered here too, and it is offered as what it is rather than as a path: `https://…`
 * names a page, not a file in this checkout, so it goes to the browser instead of the preview and
 * is never asked about on disk. The two are kept apart by one rule each — a name is anything that
 * could be a file, and a link needs an `http` or `https` scheme — which is the same pair
 * `DocumentPane` and the backend's opener already decide on.
 *
 * Nothing here decides whether a file exists: `../` and `/etc/hosts` come out of this just fine
 * and are refused later, by the one component that knows the checkout. Keeping the guess (what
 * does this text look like) apart from the fact (is this openable) is what lets the first be a
 * pure function and the second be a single IPC per hovered line.

 *
 * A bare name is a different question, and the answer belongs to the line rather than to the

 * nothing. A listing is told apart from a sentence by what separates its parts: names stand alone
 * on their line under `ls -1`, and `ls` sets them in columns more than one space apart, and a
 * sentence does neither. So a bare name is offered on a listing and nowhere else.
 *
 * Whether the name is a file this checkout holds is not decided here and never was: the probe asks
 * the disk, and it asks the disk before it asks the database, so what survives the guess costs one
 * lookup rather than a wrong answer drawn on screen.
