 * lost one for real had nothing left. An attempt here is a context asked for again.
 *
 * The recovery is a new addon rather than the old one, and that is not a detail: `WebglAddon` is
 * a disposable, so reloading one that has already been disposed leaves its renderer disposed on
 * arrival and the terminal on the fallback with no way back. The old one was disposed by the loss

 * screen element, so nothing is left stacked up and nothing is disposed twice. A fresh one builds
 * a fresh `WebglRenderer`, and the render service swaps the DOM renderer out for it through the
 * same `setRenderer` call the addon already makes when it lets go.
 *
 * Waiting for the window to come back is what keeps this from thrashing: a context lost while the
 * window was hidden is usually restored by the time anybody looks at it, and the reader behind it
 * is producing output the whole time. A loss while it is already visible has no such moment to
 * wait for, and it gets the delay above instead — the recovery runs on its own rather than on the
 * next time the window happens to change, because a terminal that loses a context under memory
 * pressure can sit visible for the rest of the day and should not be on the fallback for all of
 * it. A terminal that never had WebGL is not recovering from a lost context and is not retried at
 * all, which leaves the existing fallback exactly as it was.
