/**
 * A plain click on a shell prompt puts the shell's own cursor where the click was, so the next
 * character is typed there instead of at the end of the line.
 *
 * A terminal is not a text field. Everything typed goes to whatever is reading the PTY, and a shell
 * only knows where its cursor is because the keys that moved it were sent. A click is a mouse event
 * that never reached the shell at all — xterm turns it into a selection, which is the right thing
 * for output and useless for a command line. So the click is measured here and answered with the
 * keys a person pressing the arrow keys would have sent, which is the only thing the shell's line
 * editor understands. It is what alt+click already does in xterm.js, without the modifier: nobody
 * holds alt to place a cursor in the command they are writing.
 *
 * Which cells may be clicked is the shell's answer and not this one's. OSC 133's `B` marker rides at
 * the end of `PS1`, so the cell the terminal was parsing it on is where the editable line begins, and
 * the cursor is the other end of it: a click between those two is inside the command being written,
 * and a click anywhere else is on a prompt or on output, which is left alone. The same markers keep
 * this away from the applications that already handle clicks themselves. The `C` marker arrives
 * before a command runs, so nothing is editable once one starts, and an editor running behind the
 * prompt — vim, an OpenCode session — turns on mouse tracking as well. Neither is asked what the
 * shell thinks it is doing; both say the same thing, which is that this line is not being edited
 * here.
 *
 * The line's start is held in a marker rather than as a row number, because the buffer scrolls and
 * reflows under a prompt that is being typed at, and a row number would quietly come to name a
 * different line once it did.
 *
 * No Vue and no IPC: the only thing this asks of the session is where to write, and the only thing
 * it reads is the terminal it was handed.
