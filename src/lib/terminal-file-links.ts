/**
 * Paths in the terminal that open in the preview on ctrl+click, and web links that open in the
 * browser on the same key.
 *
 * xterm.js has a link provider for exactly this: it asks, once per hovered line, what that line
 * offers, and underlines whatever comes back. But it has no way to know whether a path names a
 * file, and it draws the underline the moment the mouse arrives. Both are wanted here, so the
 * provider answers asynchronously: it asks the backend whether each candidate is a file this
 * checkout holds and the preview can draw, and only hands xterm the ones that are. A path that
 * does not exist is never underlined, which is the whole behaviour.
 *
 * A URL is the other half of the same feature and needs none of that: it names a page rather
 * than a file, so there is nothing to confirm and nothing to ask the disk about. It is offered
 * from the text itself and can be underlined on the same tick the mouse arrives. `https` or
 * `http` only, which is the pair the opener on the other end opens and everything else it
 * refuses — a terminal that prints `file:///…` or `vscode://…` gets no underline rather than a
 * link that opens the wrong thing.
 *
 * The cost is one IPC per hovered line rather than per mouse move, because xterm asks per line
 * and stops asking until the line changes. The answers are cached because a terminal prints the
 * same path over and over, and the cache is what keeps a slow disk from making the underline
 * stutter as the mouse travels down a build log.
 *
 * The underline is xterm's own and nothing here paints one. xterm underlines the whole range a
 * link covers — every row it spans, not only the one under the pointer — in the terminal's own
 * foreground, and it does it from the same event a link's `hover` is called on. Registering a
 * decoration to recolour the path instead fires `onDecorationRegistered`, which makes xterm clear
 * and repaint the screen, and that repaint drops the underline it had just drawn: a hovered path
 * came out recoloured and not underlined. So a path is one link over its whole range and the
 * renderer draws it.
 *
 * Activation is deliberately narrow: xterm activates a link on any click, so `activate` opens
 * nothing unless ctrl or cmd is held. A plain click on a path or a link stays what it was: a click
 * that selects nothing, which the selection copy already ignores. Terminal output is not the
 * user's own text, so nothing in a build log can open a browser on its own.
