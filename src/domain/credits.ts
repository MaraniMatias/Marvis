 * Every licence below requires its notice to travel with the software, and until this existed the

 * the Fira Code OFL beside the fonts in a directory Vite never bundles, the Zed palette credit in
 * a comment above a `:root` block. A person with the app installed had none of them.
 *
 * No versions. A version written by hand is wrong the first time a dependency is bumped and nothing
 * here would say so; `pnpm-lock.yaml` is the record of what this build actually links against.
