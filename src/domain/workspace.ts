 *
 * - The agent session's own title, when this terminal's program is confirmed to be the agent and
 *   wrote one. It is the only name that came from the thing running rather than from the place it
 *   runs.
 * - The program in front of the shell, read from the OS.
 * - The name the session was opened with, which is where a rename shows.
 *
 * **The row says nothing about where the terminal is.** The worktree or branch row directly above
 * already carries that identity, and repeating it on every child gave two sibling shells the same
 * text — `zsh · Muster` twice, side by side — which is the one thing a list of terminals cannot be:
 * two rows the reader cannot tell apart. So the name is the session and nothing else: an idle shell
 * reads `zsh`, a running one reads `pnpm` or `opencode`, a renamed one reads its rename, and an
 * identified agent reads its session's title.
 *
 * Two idle shells in one worktree therefore both read `zsh`. That is truthful — nothing observed
 * distinguishes them — and it is why the row's accessible name carries its state as well and why a
 * rename remains the way to tell two of them apart. No ordinal, timestamp or id is invented here to
 * fill the gap.
