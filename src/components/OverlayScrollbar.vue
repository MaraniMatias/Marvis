/**
 * Marvis' own scrollbar, drawn over a scrolling box that keeps scrolling itself.
 *
 * The box is left alone on purpose: `overflow-y: auto` gives the wheel, the keyboard and the
 * trackpad's own momentum for free, and none of them need this element to exist. What it cannot
 * give is a bar that says how far down the box is — the browser's is either a gutter taken out of
 * every list or an overlay that sits on top of the content with a padding reserved to keep the text
 * out from under it, and a panel wants neither. So the native bar is hidden (in `style.css`, the
 * same way xterm's is) and this draws a five-pixel thumb into the padding that was reserved for it.
 *
 * It is an overlay rather than a participant in layout: it covers the right edge of whatever
 * positioned box it is placed in and costs it no width. That is why the thumb's geometry is a
 * fraction of the content's height rather than a scrollbar the browser sizes — see
 * `overlay-scrollbar.ts`, which is this file's arithmetic with no DOM in it.
