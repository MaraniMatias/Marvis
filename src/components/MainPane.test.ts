/**
 * The panel hands each pane a box, and how it says so is a contract rather than a style choice.
 *
 * Tailwind emits `.absolute` before `.relative` in the same layer at equal specificity, so a pane
 * whose own root says `relative` silently overrules an `absolute inset-0` handed down to it. Its
 * own `relative` is what the overlay scrollbars' absolutely positioned rails need an ancestor for,
 * so it is not going away, and `inset-0` under `position: relative` only offsets a box: it does not
 * stretch one. The pane is left content-sized, its scroll container has nothing to scroll in, the
 * document is drawn at full length under a panel that clips it, and the wheel turns nothing.
 *
 * So a pane that says `relative` has to be given a height, and one that does not can keep taking
 * `absolute inset-0`. Nothing here can measure a height — happy-dom has no layout engine — so what
 * is pinned is the class each pane is handed, which is the half that actually decides it.
