/**
 * Generates the file-type icon table from Catppuccin's icon set.
 *
 * The drawings are Catppuccin's. They reach us packaged as a Zed extension, which is why there is
 * nothing to install and no package to depend on: the theme is a JSON file mapping names and
 * extensions to SVG files, and the SVGs are 16x16 single-stroke shapes. This reads one flavour and
 * writes a TypeScript module holding just the rules and the inner markup of the icons they reach,
 * so nothing is fetched at runtime and the CSP is untouched: the markup is rendered inline rather
 * than through `img-src`.
 *
 * One flavour is read because Catppuccin's light and dark flavours are the same 656 drawings with
 * the palette swapped: verified shape by shape, and named the same way in the theme file. So the
 * colour is written as a `--marvis-icon-*` token rather than baked in, and `src/marvis.css` answers
 * with the palette the theme in effect asks for. Which palette a colour belongs to is Catppuccin's
 * own naming, and it is the same name in every flavour, so the token is that name. The three
 * colours the set paints with outside the palette (`#3700ff`, `#df8e1d` and `#fff`) are the same in
 * every flavour and stay where they are.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/generate-catppuccin-icons.mjs <path-to-icons-checkout>
 * The checkout is not vendored; see the header of the generated module for the source.
 *
 * The module's header carries Catppuccin's MIT notice, which its licence makes a condition of
 * redistributing the drawings. It is written here rather than pasted into the module by hand, so
 * that regenerating keeps it.
