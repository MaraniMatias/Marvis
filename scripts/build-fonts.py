"""Strip TrueType hinting out of the bundled woff2 faces.

Every bundled face shipped Fira Code's full hinting bytecode: a 3.6KB `fpgm`,
a `prep`, a `cvt `, and a `gasp` asking for grid-fitting at every ppem with no
large-ppem escape hatch. CoreText, which macOS uses, ignores that bytecode
entirely, so the app already looked right there. FreeType, which Linux uses,
executes it, and at 1x a 14px cell is exactly where snapping stems to the pixel
grid shows: uneven stem weight between glyphs, and under fontconfig's default
`hintmetrics=hintfull`, advances rounded to whole pixels so the terminal cell
drifts from the macOS one.

Removing the bytecode leaves both platforms rasterizing the same unhinted
outlines -- which is what macOS already drew, and what `src/marvis.css` says
bundling these faces is for. Outlines, advance widths and the GSUB/GPOS
features Fira Code's ligatures depend on are left untouched.

Inputs are the prepared woff2 files described in `src/assets/fonts/README.md`:
the Fira Code 6.2 release `woff2/` folder, and the already-subset
NerdSymbols.woff2. Re-running this on an already-stripped file rewrites the
same bytes, so it doubles as the check that the committed fonts are hint-free.

Note that emptying a glyph's `program` is not enough: `_g_l_y_f.py` decides
whether to emit an instruction block from `hasattr(glyph, "program")`, so the
attribute has to go. `removeHinting()` is what fontTools' own subsetter uses
for `--no-hinting`, and it only removes the instructions when the glyph still
holds its unexpanded `data` -- so this script never touches `getGlyphSet()` or
any other expanding accessor before trimming.

`recalcBBoxes=False` is what keeps the outlines bit-for-bit. With it on, `glyf`
expands every glyph and renormalizes the bounds, and in NerdSymbols 787 icons
whose cached `xMin` sits one unit away from their real leftmost point come back
moved by that unit. With it off, `glyf.compile` writes each trimmed `data`
verbatim, so the only bytes that change are the instruction bytes that `trim`
splices out.

The committed binaries were produced with fontTools 4.62.1. A different version
can compress differently, and the sha256 pins in `scripts/artifacts.test.mjs`
are what will report that.
